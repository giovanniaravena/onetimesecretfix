# ONETIME - DOCKER IMAGE - 2022-07-09
#
# To use this image, you need a Redis database with persistence enabled.
# You can start one with Docker using i.e.:
#
# Usage (Docker Compose):
#
#   When bringing up a frontend container for the first time, makes
#   sure the database container is already running and attached.
#
#     $ docker-compose up --attach-dependencies --build onetime
#
#   If you ever need to force rebuild a container:
#
#     $ docker-compose build --no-cache onetime
#
#
# Usage (Docker):
#
# $ docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis
#
# Then start this image, specifying the URL of the redis database:
#
# $ docker run -p 3000:3000 -d \
#     -e ONETIMESECRET_REDIS_URL="redis://172.17.0.1:6379/0" \
#     onetimesecret
#
# It will be accessible on http://localhost:3000.
#
# Production deployment
# ---------------------
#
# When deploying to production, you should protect your Redis instance
# with authentication or Redis networks. You should also enable
# persistence and save the data somewhere, to make sure it doesn't get
# lost when the server restarts.
#
# You should also change the secret to something else, and specify the
# domain it will be deployed on.
# For instance, if OTS will be accessible from https://example.com:
#
# $ docker run -p 3000:3000 -d \
#     -e ONETIMESECRET_REDIS_URL="redis://user:password@host:port/0" \
#     -e ONETIMESECRET_SSL=true -e ONETIMESECRET_HOST=example.com \
#     -e ONETIMESECRET_SECRET="<put your own secret here>" \
#     onetimesecret
#
